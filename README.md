# LeetCode 75 - My Learning Journey

Personal practice repository documenting my journey through LeetCode 75 problems. Learning Go first, then implementing in Python.

## 🎯 My Approach

1. **Problem Statement** - Understanding the challenge
2. **Example** - Working through test cases  
3. **Go Solution** - Primary implementation (learning Go)
4. **Python Solution** - Secondary implementation



## ✅ What Works

All solutions here have passed LeetCode tests. The code works as-is.

## 🚀 Journey Status

Currently working through the problems - lots more to do. This is my personal learning documentation, but feel free to follow along and see my progress.

## 📝 Note

This is for my own learning. Everything published here works and is free to use. Watch my journey as I tackle these problems!
